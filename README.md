# Overview

This project implements shared core portion of Jackson Data Processor, including (for version 2.0 at least) JSON implementation.
The only commonly shared part that is not included are annotations; these are found from `jackson-core-annotations` project.

Note that the main differences compared to 1.0 core jar are:

* Maven build instead of Ant
* Annotations carved out to a separate package (that this package depends on)
* Java package is now `com.fasterxml.jackson.core` (instead of `org.codehaus.jackson`)
